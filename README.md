Old as-is code for Lucal, a dynamic maze game

In Lucal: Curse of the Catacombs, You play as Lucal, an explorer looking for the fabled Obsidian Anubis Statue.
You must navigate through dark dynamically generated mazes using only your flashlight.

NOTE: Lucal is no longer in development. We wanted to have the mazes to be a dynamically changing landscape.
      When we tried to add it in, we had some issues, and felt that it wast best to hold development until a
      later date.

Check out the Screenshots and APK in the repository.
